# Bloody_Media_To_Light_Converter
Hello, this is my first project on GitHub. Thanks to it, users of Bloody keyboards can convert video(mp4) or picture(png,jpg,jpeg) into backlight. 
Instruction: 
1) Download the file "Multi_Converter.py". 
2) Move it to an empty folder 
3) Start the file:"Setup.py"
4) Run the "python Multi_Converter.py" command file via the console 
5) On the first run, specify "1" on the question "First Launch", in the following you can press Enter 
6) Choose the converter you need(Video, Photo) 
7) Write the file name you want to see in Bloody Software 
8) Write the name of your file with the format(example.png video.mp4) 
9) Turn on post-processing(makes the picture brighter, sometimes can really improve the result) command "y" or skip it by pressing Enter 
10) In case of png image with alpha channel, you need to turn it off, to do this write y, if jpg or png without alpha channel press enter 
11) Go to KeyDominator2 
12) Go to RGB Animation 
13) Go to the RGB animation sub-item 
14) Go to the section you want (in case of Animation video and Full Color photos) 
15) Click on the "File" button, open and find your generated file there 
16) Select it and click to open 
17) Done, now you have received Animation/Static backlight and can edit it 
18) To apply, go back to RGB Animation and attach some FN+ key combination to your file.  
19) Click Apply in the bottom right corner 
20) Ready, nice use.
